## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I enhanced my understanding of responsive design and how to effectively use CSS Flexbox and Grid to create adaptable layouts. I also learned how to implement CSS custom properties for maintaining a consistent design system across the project.

Here are a few specific things I learned:

- **Responsive Design**: I practiced creating layouts that adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes using media queries. This helped me understand the importance of a mobile-first approach.

- **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: I used Flexbox for aligning items in a row and Grid for more complex layouts. This combination allowed me to create a flexible and responsive design.

- **CSS Custom Properties**: By using CSS variables, I was able to maintain consistency in colors and spacing, making it easier to update the design globally.

Here's a code snippet that I'm particularly proud of:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: start;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
